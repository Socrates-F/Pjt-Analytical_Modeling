# 📊 Time Series Modeling - Ilha Solteira

This project aims to apply **time series analysis and modeling techniques** using data from the **Ilha Solteira Hydroelectric Plant**. The study covers the entire process: from data exploration to the construction of predictive models, helping to understand historical behavior and forecast future values.

## 🚀 What was done

- **Data loading and preprocessing**  
  - Importing the dataset from Excel.  
  - Date column conversion and standardization.  
  - Setting monthly frequency for the time series.  

- **Exploratory analysis**  
  - Visualization of the historical series.  
  - Annual boxplots to identify patterns and dispersion.  
  - Stationarity tests (ADF).  

- **Series decomposition**  
  - Trend, seasonality, and random component.  

- **Statistical modeling**  
  - Fitting **ARIMA** and **SARIMAX** models.  
  - Automatic parameter selection with `pmdarima`.  
  - Residual evaluation and diagnostic tests.  

- **Model validation**  
  - Performance metrics (MAE, RMSE).  
  - Comparison between forecasts and observed values.
